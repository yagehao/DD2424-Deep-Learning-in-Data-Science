## Assignment 1: Classification using one layer network

Train and test a one layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from CIFAR-10 dataset. Apply mini-batch gradient descent with cost function and L2 regularization.

## Assignment 2: Classification using two layer network

Train and test a two layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Apply mini-batch gradient descent with cost function and L2 regularization.

## Assignment 3: Predict the language of a surname from its spelling

Train a two-layer ConvNet to predict the language of a surname from its spelling.

## Assignment 4: Synthesize English text

Train an RNN to synthesize English text character by character using the text from the book 'The Goblet of Fire' by J.K. Rowling.

## Group Project: Metal Artifact Reduction in CT Images using CycleGAN
Train a cycleGAN to reduce the metal artifact in CT images and improve the cycleGAN generator by introducing a artifact fusing protocal.
